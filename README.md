My NVIM config featuring basic QOL options, general improvements to coding process, some advanced stuff like full ipynb files support and more fun / beginner friendly options like a plugin for typing practice with activity tracking, kyboard shortcuts cheet sheet etc.
Pretty sure it would need additional configuration on your end but it works on my machine at least.

To install:
```
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak # back up your current configuration if you have one
git clone https://github.com/rainyra1n/nevervim ~/.config/nvim
```
and probably spend like 2 hours downloading more stuff for it to work
